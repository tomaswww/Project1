# Portfolio_Site_Udacity

## Introduction

Portfolio Site is a project that I developed for the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program at Udacity.
The game's design was based on a mockup design by our Mentors at the nanodegree.

## Objective

This project is purely experimental and for learning purposes.
What I intended to do is put in practice concepts and skills learned throughout the Nanodegree.
The main goal was to replicate the mockup design given to us by our course mentors.
